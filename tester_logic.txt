test with writing (write only the language counterpart needed to learn)
test with choosing (comaperd to either one of the languages)
random order of words
3(or N times, user chosen) times need to get correct to remove from unknown words

Idea came from learning swedish vocabulary and Duolingo and Memrise just won't do it because different words(no IT-svenska words) and annoying adds.
